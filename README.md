# What is Ubique?
Ubique is the Latin word for "anywhere". With Ubique, you can access Wikipedia, no matter where you are, or read any book from the Gutenberg Project.

# How it works
Using Flask, we setup a Python webserver that serves the files you want to your device through a website. You search a word on Wikipedia and we give you a Wikipedia article.
